TrailFix--a Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com/) Asycnchronus web app portfolio project: a responsive app that helps users search for nearby trails by city. 

Summary:  I like exploring, hiking, and being outdoors, but information on where to find trails is not always readily available.  By using TrailFix users can search any desired state and city to find nearby trails.  Users can view the results of the locations of nearby trails,  as well as a description, or directions on how to get to the trail.
